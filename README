This is code for creating planet ROS, an aggregation of ROS blogs.

It uses Planet Venus, a rewrite of Planet. More info at: http://www.intertwingly.net/code/venus/


INSTALL

On Ubuntu, to test after installing docker you can just run build.bash


USAGE

From the current folder, run:


Everything will be built in the ``build`` folder.
The index will be in ``./output/index.html``. You might need to change variables to
build and output to different folders: ``output_theme``, ``cache_directory``, ``output_dir`` and ``filter_directories``.

This is deployed to github pages via a nightly cron job on travis, as well as on every commit to master changing the config.
PRs will be test run but not deployed.

SECURITY

By default, all potential HTML threats are removed (iframe, javascript, embed ...).
The filter wg_desanitizer.py (in ./filters) creates some exceptions to that rule:
- if <object> contains a Youtube video, an iframe is created cotaining it
